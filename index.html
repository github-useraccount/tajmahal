                The <b>Taj Mahal</b> is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of 
                the river Yamuna in the Indian city of <b>Agra</b>. It was commissioned in <b>1632</b>
                 by the Mughal emperor <b>Shah Jahan </b>  <b>(1628 to 1658)</b> to house the
                 tomb of his favourite wife,<b>Mumtaz Mahal</b>.It also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.

               for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces 
               of the world's heritage".It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and 
               a symbol of India's rich history.The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007,
               it was declared a winner of the <b> 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative</b>

              The construction began in the year <b>1632</b>. The Taj Mahal 
              is believed to have been completed entirely in <b>1653</b> at a cost around <b>70 billion rupees</b>.The project employed <b>20,000</b>

          <p>
            Well, the Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the <b>Yamuna River</b>  
            in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the <b>Agra District</b>

          <p> 
            Recent threats have come from <b>environmental pollution</b> on the banks of the Yamuna River
               due to the <b>Mathura Oil Refinery</b> near the Taj Mahal.
              The pollution has been turning the Taj Mahal <b>yellow-brown</b>.To help control the pollution, the Indian government
              has set up the <b>Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ)</b>, a 10,400-square-kilometre area around the monument
              As a conclusion,Humans are responsible for its colour change caused due to
             pollution and we, human-being are again responsible for its keep-up!

              The <b>tomb</b> is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. The <b>main chamber</b> houses 
                the <b>false tomb</b> of <b>Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan</b>; the actual graves are at a <b>lower level</b>.
                The upper cenotaphs are only illusory and the real graves are in the <b>lower</b> tomb 
                chamber (crypt), a practice adopted in the Mughal tombs.The cenotaph of Shah Jahan is <b>greater</b> than Mumtaz Mahal and installed more than thirty years later

            The bodies of <b>Mumtaz and Shah Jahan</b> were put in a relatively <b>plain</b> crypt beneath the inner chamber

            beside Mumtaz's to the <b>western side</b>. His cenotaph is bigger than his wife's, but reflects the same
            elements. The tomb of Shah Jahan bears a calligraphic inscription that reads; <b>"He travelled from 
            his world to the banquet-hall of Eternity on the night of the twenty-sixth of the month of Rajab, in 
            the year 1076 Hijri"</b>

            The most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The dome is nearly <b>35 metres

            corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome.The main finial was originally made of <b>gold</b> but
            was replaced by a copy made of <b>gilded bronze</b> 19th century. The finial is topped by a <b>moon</b>, a typical Islamic motif

            The exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. The calligraphy on the <b> Great Gate </b>
            reads <b>"O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you."</b> Much of the calligraphy 
            is composed of <b>florid thuluth script</b> made of  <b>black marble</b> inlaid in white marble panels. The door frames and archways
            have been decorated with inlays of highly stylised, almost <b>geometric vines, flowers and fruits</b>.

            The interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The four central upper arches form balconies
            or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or <b>Jali</b> cut from marble. The octagonal marble screen
            or jali bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work. The remaining surfaces are 
            inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious stones forming twining vines, fruits and inlaid <b> flower plant motifs.</b>

              A longstanding myth holds that Shah Jahan is said to have desired a mausoleum for 
              himself similar to that of the one he had built in memory of his second wife, which
              would have been called the <b>Black Taj, Kaala Taj</b>(also called <b>The 2nd Taj</b>)
              a <b>black marble</b> mausoleum) that is said to have been planned to be built across
              the <b>Yamuna River</b> opposite the <b>Taj Mahal</b> in Agra. A French traveller, 
              <b>Jean Baptiste Tavernier</B> mentioned the idea of 
              Black Taj in his writings. He suggested Shah Jahan could not complete it as he was deposed
              by his own son <b>Aurangzeb.</b> The tomb of Shah Jahan is the <b>only visible 
              asymmetric element</b> in the <b>entire complex</b>, As it is located to
              the western side of the centrally located tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Its position
              gives rise to the speculation that his tomb was <b>meant to be somewhere 
              else.</b>
